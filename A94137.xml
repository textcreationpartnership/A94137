         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Petition was our only way; To live and dye together in one and the ſame opinion was our mutuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; To preſerve our Antient and Fundamentall Lawes, to purchaſe our juſt Liberties, To conſerve the Kings known Rights, were our ſolemne Proteſtations. All theſe being now
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:163957:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 33 -->like <hi>Sampſons</hi> cords, broken, I believe my ſelfe diſengaged: The Reformation deſired is extirpation endeavoured; In ſtead of Petition, as Subjects ought, we command as Rebells uſe; The preſervation of our Antient and Fundamentall Lawes, is out-lawed by new Votes, and illegall Ordinances; The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of our juſt Liberties, is turn'd into unjuſt licentiouſneſſe; And the conſervation of the Kings known Rights, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd by unknown wrongs; And our living and dying in one and the ſame Opinion, is crumbled away into, <hi>So many men, ſo many minds;</hi> of our firſt <hi>Juncto,</hi> how many <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> how many <hi>Independants</hi> we both know; of thoſe <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> how many are <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> how many are <hi>Jacobins</hi> you know not; of thoſe <hi>Independents,</hi> how many are Antinomians, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are <hi>Browniſts,</hi> I know not: And though we both know what we would not have, yet neither of us know what we would have.</p>
            <p>Would we have no Biſhops Sit in Parliament? an Act is paſſed for it, the King hath ſigned it. Though I muſt tell you, that very Act hath cancelled one of our beſt Fundamentalls; The beſt part of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is thereby diſſolved, and hath put the whole into an Ague.</p>
            <p>Would we have no impoſition of Ship-mony? the like courſe is taken, and the like power hath confirmed it. Though I muſt tell you, this very eaſe of Ship-mony, hath brought a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe upon our Ship-ſtrength; and whereas before we were well nigh able to cope with all the Navies of Chriſtendome, we have ſcarce any more left now then the bare name of a Navy.</p>
            <p>Would we have no Monopolies? They are damn'd too by the like Authority; though I muſt tell you, the very taking away of this yoake hath made the whole Kingdome a Monopolie; the ſeverall Committees have got a Monopoly of our Coyne and all that is Coynable; The ſeverall Commanders have got a Monopoly of our Cattell, and all that is Edible; ſome there be that have got a Monopoly of our Wives and all that is Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; others of our Children, and all that is Delectable; others
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:163957:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 33 -->of our Servants, and all that is Profitable; others of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and all that is Sociable: The Muſter-Roll ſince our laſt beſieging of <hi>Baſing,</hi> aſſures me, we are 21500. weaker then we were; and Major <hi>Copley</hi> will witneſſe it with me.</p>
            <p>Would we have no Ceremonies lye heavy upon tender Conſciences? That hath been offered us too; Though I muſt tell you, we that ſtumbled at theſe Gnats, have ſince ſwallowed Camells; we that would not be impoſed upon our ſelves, doe our ſelves impoſe upon others, Burthens too heavy for them, our ſelves, or any man elſe to beare.</p>
            <p>Would wee have no Papiſts? we were in a faire way for that too; we might have forc'd their children to an education under Proteſtants: Though I muſt tell you, <hi>but under the Roſe be it ſpoken,</hi> This had been a piece of abſolute Tyranny; and would have been required with the Abolition of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in all the World, ſave <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is it we did privatively deſire, and the King did po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively deny? He was not weary of Granting, 'till we were ſhameleſſe and unreaſonable in demanding. To a Regulation of Biſhops He conſented; He declined only their Extirpation; would we have no Biſhops? Why? becauſe they have not <hi>Jus divinum</hi> to plead for them? it remaines yet undecided; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcoparians affirm it; The Anti-Epiſcoparians deny it; and yet grant by conſequence, what they challenge by concluſion. That Epiſcopacy hath <hi>Jus Apoſtolicum</hi> for their Advocate. Or is it becauſe ſome of them are bad? Vpon the ſame ground would we have no Judges, no Aldermen, no Knights, no Lords, no Parliaments; All have not been good: becauſe ſome are, let their preſcription of time forbid the proſcription of their Fanction.</p>
            <p>Miſtake me not yet, Sir, I am no Patron, no Advocate, no Pleader for Epiſcopacy; I am an <hi>Independent,</hi> I was ſo when I firſt entred into this combination, and ſo will dye; And ſuch a one were you at that time, though now you have forgot your firſt Faith, and are turn'd <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> yet ſtill I am, as I was then, a perfect Biſhop hater; but why I am ſo, I know no more

               <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->this laſt Summer, the Kings Souldiers were the ſtronger men, and gained againſt us both: you know in what a low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we both were, when Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> lay before <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> how tumultuous the <hi>Londoners</hi> were when <hi>Leyceſter</hi> was taken, and how we were reſolved to paſſe over the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, if <hi>Nasby</hi> fight had gone againſt us: And to whom we owe the thankfulneſſe of that, whether to Generall <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Presbyterians under him, or to Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Independents under him, let our Enemies ſpeake; Their witneſſe will be the beſt, we may be partiall to our ſelves.</p>

Epiſcopacy may ſtand, and we enjoy our Conſciences, Presbytery will not allow it; Epiſcopacy may enjoy their Lands, and we our Farmes, not ſo with Presbytery; For they intend as well a Reformation of the State, as of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> of long Gownes into ſhort Clokes, of Lawne Sleeves into fine Shirts, of <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> into <hi>Suum,</hi> of Godlineſſe into Gaine; And our <hi>Copy-holds,</hi> if they once come to the queſtion, <hi>whether</hi> they be as Antichriſtian as the Churches Lands, into their owne Purſes: It is not a Reformation they ſeeke, but an Alteration; and that Alteration ſhall but make way for an Alienation, To bring the Kings Crowne under Chriſts Scepter, which themſelves will manage, not for Chriſt, but againſt Chriſt; For his Kingdome is not of this world.</p>
            <p>We Independents ſeek only a Reformation, not an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we have yet ſo much Reaſon, as to ſee, The further we ſwerve from our firſt Conſtitutions, the nearer we haſten to Deſolation; The further from our Fundamentall Principles, the nearer to our perpetuall Ruine? It is ſo in the Church, it is ſo in the State. I inſtance only in the State: The firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and Fundamentall Principle of this Kingdome is, There ſhould be a King, and Subjects; That the King ſhould Rule, the Subjects ſhould obey: He Rule according to Law, They obey according to Conſcience. That He ſhould ſecure the Kingdome againſt Forreigne Enemies; That they ſhould aſſiſt him therein; That both ſhould conſcientiouſly intend the publick Peace, and the Kingdomes happineſſe: we find all this done, while we had but one King, and many Subjects; And we find all this undone, now we have many Kings, and no Subjects: To regaine all, we would come to our firſt Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and live in ſubjection under that one whom God hath made our Superiour, and not any longer in vaſſalage under many, whom our ſelves have made.</p>
            <p>A ſecond or another firſt Conſtitution of this Kingdome, is, we ſhould have Parliaments; that thoſe Parliaments ſhould conſiſt of three States, Lords Spirituall, Lords Temporall, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:163957:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->the Houſe of Commons; But one of theſe three, <hi>the Lords Spirituall</hi> being found ſuperfluous, we ſay of two States, the Houſe of Peers, and the Houſe of Commons; The Houſe of Commons to find out the Grievances of the Kingdome, and to prepare Redreſſes of thoſe Grievances for the Houſe of Peers, the Houſe of Peers to preſent them to the King, and the King to ſigne them with His Royall <hi>Fiat</hi> for Lawes: All this hath been done while the Houſe of Parliament prepared Lawes for the King to confirme them; All this hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, ſince the two Houſes have made Lawes for the King to obey them: our Grievances were redreſſed before, They are increaſed now; we had ſome Liberties then, and hope of all Liberties we could deſire: we have no Liberties now, nor hope of any; we had good Lawes before, whereby we knew ſinne; we have many ſinnes now, yet know no Law: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine our Lawes and Liberties, we would come to our firſt Conſtitution, and have two Houſes to acknowledge one King above them, and not one King to acknowledge two Houſes above Him.</p>
            <p>It may be you will ſay, <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori, cùm Culpa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar guit ipſum,</hi> why have I hither to took part with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the King? with the Parliament, I confeſſe, I have, but not againſt the King: For when I firſt entred into this Compact, by Proteſtation, by Vow, and Covenant, it was to fetch the King up unto his Parliament, out of the hands of Evill Councellors; That was the only pretended reaſon for the raiſing of all our Armies, ſave the very laſt under Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fairfax;</hi> He was the firſt Generall, that ever received Command to deny Quarter to any, even to the King himſelfe: And this was not diſcloſed untill of late, elſe I had publiſhed it, and our reſolution in this point ſooner.</p>
            <p>But now it is knowne; and yet I ſtill ſide with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I confeſſe I doe; but not as I did before; Before I did it ſincerely; now I doe it politickly; The Parliaments Cauſe, <hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> is a <hi>good Cauſe to live in;</hi> For hereby I ſave mine owne ſtake, and get a good ſhare in other mens; But now
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:163957:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 36 -->I am weary of it; For now I would manage ſuch a Cauſe, as I might <hi>live and dye in: live in with Profit, and aye in with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> The courſe I have hitherto taken, I profeſſe, I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for meere gaine; The courſe I would now take, I profeſſe, I would undertake for meere Godlineſſe; I would not at my Death renounce a wicked courſe, as Colonell <hi>Sandys</hi> did at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and Major <hi>Abercromye</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire;</hi> For then it would be too late, becauſe I cannot goe to Heaven without Repentance; and Repentance cannot be true which hath not this Ingredient, <hi>Doe good,</hi> as well as that, <hi>Ceaſe to doe Evill:</hi> I muſt receive the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>The Gospell,</hi> into me, before I can hope to be received into the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Glory.</hi> And you know; <hi>To the Poor is the Gospell Preached;</hi> And though I am <hi>rich in ſubſtance,</hi> yet I am <hi>poore enough in ſpirit,</hi> I thanke God for it, and would you were ſo too, to receive the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Sir, by this that hath been ſaid, you know the Reſolution of our Party; There wants nothing but the Kings offer to invite us, and ere long we intend to invite Him to that offer, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>That we ſhall be obliged only to honeſt Converſation by the common Lawes of this Kingdome, and freed from any, and all Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures for point of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all we deſire; and if this be granted, we preſently declare our ſelves for the King, will joyne with Him, will fight for Him, and either end our lives, or ſettle His Crowne faſt upon His Head, His Sword in His Hand, and Himſelfe in His Chaire.</p>
            <p>This we will doe, maugre the oppoſition of all Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and the whole World beſides: we will make our Army equall with that under <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> who we heare is already on this ſide <hi>Tweed,</hi> with no fewer then 14000 Foot and Horſe: The like Aſſiſtance he ſhall have from us, under the Command of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or whom elſe His Majeſty will put in Chiefe. And let it be tryed then, whether any Parochiall, Conſiſtoriall, Provinciall, or Generall Claſſis of the Clero-Laicall-Presbytery, dare <hi>thinke to Depoſe.</hi> or
